Have you ever wondered how different apps and services present in your phone seamlessly communicate with each other, allowing you to book an Uber through Google Maps or share your latest tweet on Facebook?  
All thanks to something called an **API**, which stands for **Application Programming Interface**.  

Let‚Äôs dive deeper into the world of APIs in this blog today.

## ü§î What‚Äôs an API?

In simple terms, **API** is just an **output to an input** that you gave to someone.  
They're like the **ordering system for your software**:

- They reliably provide you with **what you asked for** (predictable outputs).
